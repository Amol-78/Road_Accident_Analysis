However, large-scale raw accident data can be overwhelming and difficult to analyze without proper visualization.

## 🎯 Objective

To create an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that analyzes and visualizes road accident data in the United Kingdom. The dashboard helps identify accident trends, high-risk areas, types of vehicles involved, and conditions that contribute to accidents.
